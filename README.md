# DeFiRewards - Decentralized Loyalty Program Platform

## Project Overview

**DeFiRewards** is a blockchain-based loyalty program platform that allows businesses to create tokenized reward systems while giving users true ownership of their loyalty points through NFTs and cryptocurrency tokens.

## Problem Statement

Traditional loyalty programs suffer from several critical issues:
- Points are trapped within individual ecosystems
- No interoperability between different brands
- Points often expire and have no real value
- Users cannot trade or monetize their loyalty rewards
- Businesses lack transparent analytics on customer engagement

## Solution

DeFiRewards creates a unified, decentralized loyalty ecosystem where:
- Loyalty points are represented as transferable tokens (ERC-20)
- Special achievements unlock unique NFT badges (ERC-721)
- Cross-brand point exchanges through automated market makers
- Smart contracts ensure transparent reward distribution
- Businesses gain real-time analytics through on-chain data

## Key Features

### For Businesses
